#include "application.h"
// This includes the "application.h" header file, which likely contains definitions and declarations for the Application class or functions related to application management.

std::atomic_bool sc::visor::keep_running = true;
// This initializes the 'keep_running' atomic boolean variable in the sc::visor namespace. Atomic variables are used to guarantee that operations on them are not interrupted or manipulated concurrently by different threads. This variable is likely used to control a loop or other ongoing process, with the process continuing as long as 'keep_running' is true.

bool sc::visor::legacy_support_error = false;
// This initializes the 'legacy_support_error' boolean variable in the sc::visor namespace to false. This flag is likely used to indicate if an error occurred related to legacy support. By default, it's set to false, meaning no error has occurred.

std::optional<std::string> sc::visor::legacy_support_error_description;
// This initializes the 'legacy_support_error_description' optional string variable in the sc::visor namespace. Optional variables can contain a value or be empty (nullopt). This variable is likely used to contain a description of an error related to legacy support, if such an error occurred. By default, it's empty, meaning no error description is provided.
