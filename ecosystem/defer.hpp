~~~

Defer is used to ensure that a function call is performed later
in a programâ€™s execution, usually for purposes of cleanup. defer
is often used where e.g. ensure and finally would be used in other
languages.

~~~

Examples:

    DEFER(curl_global_cleanup());

    DEFER({
        spdlog::info("Deleting NVG context...");
        nvgDeleteGL3(vg);
    });
